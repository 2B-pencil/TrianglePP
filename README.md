Triangle++
==========

This is an updated version of Piyush Kumar's ("http://compgeom.com/~piyush) OO/C++ wrapper (https://bitbucket.org/piyush/triangle/overview) for the original J.P Shevchuk's Triangle package.

It can create Delaunay triangulation and constrainied Delaunay triangulations.

I have ported the original impl. to Visual C++ (VC9, i.e. VisStudio 2008) and extended it for constrainied triangulations and added some bugfixes. For usage patterns see the *trpp_example.cpp* source file. The interface is defined in *tpp_inteface.hpp*.

For for backgroud info on the implementation see "Triangle: Engineering a 2D Quality Mesh Generator and Delaunay Triangulator" by JP Shewchuk: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake-papers/triangle.ps

This code is released under LPGL licence.
