# Triangle++

*Triangle++* (aka *TrianglePP*) is an updated version of Piyush Kumar's [C++/OO wrapper](https://bitbucket.org/piyush/triangle/overview) for the original 2005 J.P. Shevchuk's *Triangle* package that was written in old plain C.

It can create **Delaunay** triangulations, **constrained Delaunay** triangulations and **Voronoi** diagrams.

I have ported the original wrapper to Visual C++ (VC9, i.e. VisualStudio 2008), done some bugfixes, and extended it for constrainied triangulations ands Voronoi diagrams. 

This code is released under LPGL licence.

## Update:

The code is now preliminary ported to x64 Windows. The project file was updated to Visual Studio 2015/2019, the x64 target was added, and the asserts & crashes when running the example program were fixed. It **wasn't thorougly tested though**.

*CMake* support for both the example program and the GUI demonstrator were added too recently.

## Usage:

For usage patterns see the examples in the *trpp_example.cpp* source file. The interface of the *trpp*-wrapper is defined in the *tpp_inteface.hpp* header file. 

If compiled with *TRIANGLE_DBG_TO_FILE* define, debug traces will be written to the *./triangle.out.txt* file.

Additionally, under *testappQt* you'll find a GUI programm to play with the triangulations:

and also with tesselations:

For backgroud info on the original implementation see "*Triangle: Engineering a 2D Quality Mesh Generator and Delaunay Triangulator*" by J.P. Shewchuk: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake-papers/triangle.ps.

The original *Triangle* library documentation can be found at: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html. The library was a **winner** of the 2003 James Hardy Wilkinson Prize in Numerical Software (sic!).

## TODOs:
 - Test it on 64-bit Linux
 - Port the Qt demo app to Emscripten
 - Move tests to Catch
 - add file export/import to the Qt demo app
