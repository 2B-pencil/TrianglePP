## Qt-based GUI Demonstrator for TrianglePP

A small demonstrator/tester for the library.

**Note:** On Windows it is compiled with *TRIANGLE_DBG_TO_FILE* define, so the debug traces will be written to the *./triangle.out.txt* file.

## TODOs:
 - port demo app to Emscripten
 - add file export/import (work is underway!)
 - add convex hull demonstration 
 - add zooming (???)
