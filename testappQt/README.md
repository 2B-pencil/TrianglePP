<br>

<br>

 - For some screenshots to see what this demonstrator is able to do, please consult the main *README* file of the project.
 - Also see below for the available triangulation options

**Note:** On Windows the Demo App will be compiled with *TRIANGLE_DBG_TO_FILE* define, so that its debug traces will be written to the *./triangle.out.txt* file.

## Options
The Demo App has same options that can be set, available in the *Options* menu (Ctrl+O):

## Versions
Recently this Demo App was ported to Qt6. You will find the legacy Qt5 version on a separate branch, which isn't maintained at the moment, 
i.e. there will be no backports of fixes or new features if not explicitely requested by the users!

## TODOs:

 - add visual GUI support for adding region markers and region constraints
 - save current settings and re-read them on restart


 - remove warnings
 - correct rescaling so that points on the border of frame will be entirely visible (needed ???)
 - rescale the inputs only on explicit request (and back...) 
   - needed ??? --> we already added zooming

 
 - add JPG export/screenshot
 - add convex hull demonstration (worth it ???)


 - port demo app to Emscripten
 - port demo app to Python
