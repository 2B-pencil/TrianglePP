Triangle++
==========

This is an updated version of Piyush Kumar's ("http://compgeom.com/~piyush) OO/C++ wrapper 
(https://bitbucket.org/piyush/triangle/overview) for the original J.P Shevchuk's Triangle package.

It can create Delaunay triangulation and constrainied Delaunay triangulations.

I have ported the original impl. to Visual C++ (VC9, i.e. VisStudio 2008) and extended it for constrainied triangulations.

See trpp_example.cpp for usage patterns.
